- **Primary Style:** Direct, energetic, confident
- **Register:** Casual-bold. She respects a man who says what he means.
- **Pacing:** Short punchy sentences. No walls of text.
- **Emotional Range:** High-enthusiasm, action-oriented, competitive warmth

### Message Calibration Rules per Mode

| Mode | Ideal Tone | Words That Resonate | Words to NEVER Use | Example Snippet |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| good_morning | Energetic, challenge-laced | "conquer," "fire," "unstoppable," "let's go" | "calm," "slow down," "be patient" | "Morning, firecracker. The world's not ready for you today." |
| checking_in | Casual, non-clingy | "quick," "thinking of you," "how's the mission" | "worried," "you haven't replied," "where are you" | "Hey — just wanted to say I hope you're crushing it right now." |
| appreciation | Specific and action-focused | "strong," "brave," "impressed," "nobody else could" | "sweet," "gentle," "obedient," "quiet" | "The way you handled that today — honestly, it was fearless." |
| motivation | Challenge-based, competitive | "prove them wrong," "you've got this," "warrior" | "it's okay to quit," "don't push yourself," "maybe next time" | "You were built for exactly this kind of challenge. Go show them." |
| celebration | Loud, proud, exclamation-friendly | "EPIC," "champion," "you did THAT," "legend" | "not bad," "good enough," "finally" | "YOU DID IT. I knew you would. Nobody else comes close." |
| flirting | Bold, daring, slightly competitive | "dare you," "can you handle," "trouble," "match" | "sweetie," "baby girl," "delicate" | "I dare you to tell me you're not thinking about me right now." |
| reassurance | Strong, empowering, not pitying | "fighter," "you always find a way," "unbreakable" | "poor thing," "don't cry," "it'll pass" | "You've beaten harder things than this. I'm not worried — and you shouldn't be either." |
| long_distance | Passionate, forward-looking | "countdown," "soon," "when I see you," "fire" | "this is hard," "I'm lonely," "sad" | "Every day closer to you is a day worth sprinting through." |
| apology | Direct, accountable, no groveling | "I was wrong," "you deserved better," "my fault" | "but you also," "overreacting," "calm down" | "I messed up. Straight up. You deserved better from me and I know it." |
| after_argument | Cool-down with forward momentum | "we're stronger than this," "fresh start," "team" | "let's just forget it," "whatever," "fine" | "That was rough. But we're not the kind of couple that breaks. Let's reset." |

### "Never Say This" Rules
1. "You need to relax" — Aries women hear this as dismissal of their intensity
2. "Let me handle it for you" — Undermines her independence and competence
3. "You're being too much" — Her fire is her identity; never frame it as excess
4. "Maybe you should wait" — Patience-shaming triggers instant resentment
5. "I don't want to argue" — She sees conflict as engagement; avoidance reads as weakness

### Cultural Adaptation
- **Arabic (Gulf) Aries:** Still fiery but channels it through family ambition and career drive. Replace competitive language with achievement language. "Conquer" becomes "build your empire." Public boldness is toned down; private intensity remains.
- **Malay Aries:** Expresses directness through humor rather than confrontation. Use playful dares instead of overt challenges. Soften "warrior" to "pejuang" (fighter with noble connotation). Respect for elders tempers the rebellious edge.

| after_argument | Calm restoration, comfort-focused | "let's be us again," "peaceful," "home" | "shake it off," "move faster," "get over it" | "I miss our peace. Let's find our way back to that place where it's just us." |

### "Never Say This" Rules
1. "You're being stubborn" — She calls it loyalty and consistency
2. "It's just stuff / it's just food" — Never minimize sensory pleasures
3. "Why can't you just go with the flow?" — Taurus needs stability, not chaos
4. "You're so predictable" — Reframe consistency as reliability
5. "Let's do something spontaneous RIGHT NOW" — Pressure to break routine creates anxiety

### Cultural Adaptation
- **Arabic (Gulf) Taurus:** Amplify luxury and quality references. Gulf Taurus women value brand, craftsmanship, and heritage. Use "aseel" (authentic/pure). Perfume, gold, and food references land deeply. Family comfort is paramount.
- **Malay Taurus:** Comfort expressed through food culture ("masakan ibu" — mother's cooking). Nature and garden metaphors resonate. Emphasize "selesa" (comfortable/at ease). Gift language skews toward home and kitchen luxury.

### "Never Say This" Rules
1. "You talk too much" — Communication is her love language
2. "Make up your mind" — She processes by exploring options verbally
3. "You're so scattered" — She calls it multifaceted
4. "Can we talk about one thing at a time?" — Kills her conversational flow
5. "You're being fake" — Her adaptability to different social contexts is a skill, not deception

### Cultural Adaptation
- **Arabic (Gulf) Gemini:** Social butterfly energy channeled through family gatherings and social media. References to "majlis" (gathering) culture. Intellectual curiosity expressed through poetry appreciation and language play. Arabic wordplay ("tawriya") resonates deeply.
- **Malay Gemini:** Social adaptability expressed through community involvement. "Sembang" (chat) culture is her element. Values humor and storytelling ("cerita"). Pantun (Malay poetic form) references charm her.

| checking_in | Emotionally attuned | "how are you really," "I felt something was off," "your heart" | "you're fine," "don't worry about it," "toughen up" | "Hey — how are you really? Not the polite answer. The real one." |

| after_argument | Repair through emotional reconnection | "us," "our bond," "nothing breaks this," "come here" | "get over it," "stop crying," "be rational" | "Come here. Nothing is more important than us. I hate when we're not okay." |

### "Never Say This" Rules
1. "You're too emotional" — Her emotional depth is her core identity
2. "It happened ages ago, let go" — She remembers everything; dismissing memory dismisses her
3. "Your family is too involved" — Family is sacred; criticize at your own peril
4. "Stop taking everything personally" — She processes the world through personal feeling

- **Malay Cancer:** "Keluarga" (family) is everything. References to "kampung" (village/hometown) trigger deep nostalgia. Food as love language is extremely strong. "Rindu" (longing/missing) is the word that moves her most.

| checking_in | Admiring, spotlight-giving | "how's my favorite person," "the world treating you right?" | "just checking," "you good?" (too casual) | "How's my queen today? I hope the world is treating you the way you deserve." |
| appreciation | Public-worthy praise | "magnificent," "unforgettable," "one of a kind," "star" | "decent," "not bad," "okay I guess" | "You walked in and everyone noticed. That's not confidence — that's royalty." |

### "Never Say This" Rules
1. "You're being dramatic" — Her expressiveness is not performance
2. "Nobody's even looking at you" — She needs to feel seen always
3. "You're not that special" — Instantly destroys trust and attraction
4. "Be more humble" — Confidence is her oxygen; don't restrict it
5. "I forgot" (about important dates/events) — Forgetting communicates she's not a priority

### Cultural Adaptation
- **Arabic (Gulf) Leo:** Grand gestures are expected but expressed through private luxury rather than public drama. "Malika" (queen) resonates. Status symbols matter but should be tasteful. Praise should reference her family's reputation. Public displays shift to private admiration.
- **Malay Leo:** Leadership expressed through community respect. "Mulia" (noble/gracious) is a powerful word. Praise should reference her impact on others. Less overtly theatrical but deeply values recognition within social circles.

2. "Close enough" — Mediocrity physically pains her
3. "Stop overthinking it" — Her analysis is how she shows care
4. "It doesn't matter" — Everything matters to Virgo
5. "You worry too much" — Her foresight has prevented countless problems

### "Never Say This" Rules
1. "You're too intense" — Intensity is her superpower and her identity
2. "It's not that deep" — For Scorpio, everything IS that deep
3. "I was talking to my ex" (casually) — Jealousy is nuclear; never be careless with trust
4. "You're being paranoid" — Her instincts are usually right; dismissing them is dangerous
5. "I have nothing to hide" (defensively) — Sounds exactly like someone who has something to hide

### Cultural Adaptation
- **Arabic (Gulf) Scorpio:** Intensity channels through fierce family loyalty and private passion. "Wafiya" (faithful/loyal) is the highest compliment. Privacy is paramount — never share her secrets publicly. Power dynamics are navigated through quiet influence rather than overt control.
- **Malay Scorpio:** Depth expressed through spiritual practice and loyalty bonds. "Setia" (loyal/faithful) is sacred. Mystical elements of Malay culture (bomoh traditions, spiritual awareness) can be connection points. Values depth in conversation above all.
