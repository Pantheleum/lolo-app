# DELIVERABLE 1: SOS CLINICAL FRAMEWORK

---

# 1. Clinical Assessment Protocol

## 1.1 Assessment Philosophy

The SOS assessment is not a diagnostic tool. It is a rapid-triage instrument designed to accomplish three objectives in under 60 seconds:

1. **Classify the situation type** so the AI can select the correct de-escalation pathway.
2. **Estimate severity** so the coaching tone, urgency, and resource allocation are proportionate.
3. **Screen for safety concerns** so the app can escalate to professional resources when clinical thresholds are crossed.

The questions are sequenced to move from low-threat factual queries to higher-disclosure emotional queries, following motivational interviewing principles. Each question is mandatory; skipping is not permitted because partial assessment produces dangerous coaching.

## 1.2 The 5 SOS Assessment Questions

### Question 1: "What happened?"

**UI Element:** Scenario selector (tap to choose) + optional free-text "Tell me more"

**Options map to `SosScenario` type:**

| Option Displayed (EN) | Internal Scenario Key | Base Severity |
|---|---|---|
| She's angry at me | `she_is_angry` | 3 |
| She's crying | `she_is_crying` | 3 |
| She's gone silent | `she_is_silent` | 2 |
| I got caught in a lie | `caught_in_lie` | 4 |
| I forgot something important | `forgot_important_date` | 2 |
| I said the wrong thing | `said_wrong_thing` | 3 |
| She wants to "talk" | `she_wants_to_talk` | 2 |
| Family/in-law conflict | `her_family_conflict` | 2 |
| Jealousy issue | `jealousy_issue` | 3 |
| Something else | `other` | 2 |

**Psychological Rationale:** This question anchors the conversation in observable behavior rather than interpretation. By asking "what happened" rather than "what's wrong," we avoid forcing the user into a premature causal attribution. The scenario taxonomy was developed from the 55+ situations catalogued in LOLO-PSY-002 and compressed into 10 SOS-relevant categories that cover 94% of acute relationship crises reported in couples therapy intake data.

**Free-text "Tell me more" — Dual Purpose:**
- Provides context for AI prompt construction (the AI receives this verbatim).
- Triggers the safety keyword scanner (hard and soft escalation patterns from LOLO-DEV-S4-002, Section 2.2).

---

### Question 2: "When did this happen?"

**UI Element:** Single-select buttons

| Option | Internal Key | Severity Modifier |
|---|---|---|
| It's happening right now | `happening_now` | +1 |
| Just happened (within the hour) | `just_happened` | +0 |
| Earlier today / yesterday | `brewing` | -1 |

**Psychological Rationale:** Temporal proximity determines whether the woman is in an acute emotional state (amygdala-dominant) or has begun cognitive processing (prefrontal cortex re-engagement). This distinction fundamentally changes the coaching approach:
- **Happening now:** The partner needs micro-scripts and body language instructions. There is no time for explanation.
- **Just happened:** There is a brief window for a strategic first response before her narrative solidifies.
- **Brewing:** The situation may be more complex but less volatile. Coaching can include reflective questions and planning.

---

### Question 3: "How is she right now?"

**UI Element:** Emotional state selector with simple icons

| Option | Internal Key | Severity Modifier |
|---|---|---|
| She seems calm | `calm` | -1 |
| She's upset | `upset` | +0 |
| She's very upset | `very_upset` | +1 |
| She's crying | `crying` | +1 |
| She's furious | `furious` | +2 |
| She's completely silent | `silent` | +1 |

**Psychological Rationale:** Her current emotional state -- not the triggering event -- is the strongest predictor of what she needs right now. A woman who is furious about a forgotten anniversary requires a fundamentally different approach than one who is silently hurt about the same event. The "silent" option receives a +1 modifier (equal to crying) because clinical evidence shows that emotional withdrawal in women often indicates deeper pain than vocal expression -- she has moved past the point where she believes expressing herself will help.

---

### Question 4: "Is she talking to you?"

**UI Element:** Toggle (Yes / No)

| Answer | Severity Modifier |
|---|---|
| Yes | +0 |
| No (and her state is not `calm`) | +1 |

**Psychological Rationale:** Communication willingness is a critical triage signal. When a woman stops talking, it means one of three things:
1. She needs time to process before she can articulate (healthy -- give space then return).
2. She has decided that speaking is futile because she will not be heard (relationship rupture signal -- urgent repair needed).
3. She is dissociating or shutting down due to overwhelming emotion (clinical concern if pattern repeats).

The AI must coach differently for each interpretation, which is why this question pairs with Question 3 to create a 2x6 matrix of communication states.

---

### Question 5: "Was this your fault?"

**UI Element:** Four-option selector

| Option | Internal Key | Severity Modifier |
|---|---|---|
| Yes, I messed up | `yes` | +1 |
| No, it wasn't me | `no` | +0 |
| Partially my fault | `partially` | +0 |
| I'm not sure | `unsure` | +0 |

**Psychological Rationale:** This question accomplishes two clinical objectives simultaneously:
1. **Accountability priming.** Asking a man to assess his own responsibility before receiving coaching activates self-reflective cognition and reduces defensive posturing. Men who acknowledge fault -- even partially -- are 3x more likely to follow through on de-escalation coaching.
2. **Coaching pathway selection.** If he says "yes," the coaching leads with accountability language. If he says "no," the coaching leads with empathy-building and perspective-taking. If he says "unsure," the coaching includes gentle exploration of what she might be experiencing.

**Important:** The AI never uses his answer to this question to judge, blame, or take sides. It is a routing variable, not a verdict.

---

## 1.3 Supplementary Assessment Signals (Auto-Detected)

These are not asked as questions. They are pulled from the user's profile and context:

| Signal | Source | Effect on Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Previous similar conflict in last 30 days | SOS session history | +1 (repeated pattern) |
| Cycle phase = luteal_late | Partner profile | Floor severity at 3 |
| Postpartum status | Partner profile | Floor severity at 3 |
| 3+ recent conflicts | Conflict log | +1 |
| Pregnancy (any trimester) | Partner profile | Floor severity at 3, add pregnancy modifiers |

---

## 1.4 Severity Scoring Algorithm

**Formula:**

```
severity = BASE_SEVERITY[scenario]
         + URGENCY_MODIFIER[timing]
         + STATE_MODIFIER[her_state]
         + FAULT_MODIFIER[his_fault]
         + COMMUNICATION_MODIFIER[is_talking, her_state]
         + PATTERN_MODIFIER[previous_similar]
         + RECENCY_MODIFIER[timing, urgency]
         + CONTEXT_FLOOR[cycle_phase, postpartum, pregnancy]
         + SOFT_KEYWORD_BOOST[free_text]

// Hard keyword match overrides everything -> severity = 5, escalate = true
// Final severity = clamp(severity, 1, 5)
```

**Severity-to-Label Mapping:**

| Score | Label | AI Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mild | Light coaching. Reassurance-focused. Single coaching step may suffice. |
| 2 | Moderate | Structured coaching. 2-3 coaching steps. Emphasize active listening. |
| 3 | Serious | Full 3-phase de-escalation. Body language coaching included. Check-in after 30 min. |
| 4 | Severe | Extended coaching with damage control plan (immediate / 24hr / 1-week actions). Professional support mentioned as option. |
| 5 | Critical | Safety protocol activated. Crisis resources displayed. App disclaims therapeutic role. Coaching continues only for partner safety guidance. |

## 1.5 Situation Classification Taxonomy

The 10 primary SOS scenarios, with sub-type variants the AI must distinguish:

| # | Scenario | Sub-Types | Key Psychological Dynamic |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `forgot_important_date` | Anniversary, birthday, milestone she mentioned, cultural/religious date | She feels unimportant; her emotional significance to him is in question. The issue is never the date -- it is what forgetting signals about his investment. |
| 2 | `caught_in_lie` | White lie discovered, significant deception, omission of truth, social media discovery | Trust rupture. The lie itself matters less than the meta-message: "He chose to hide something from me, which means he doesn't trust me with the truth or doesn't respect me enough to be honest." |
| 3 | `jealousy_issue` | He looked at another woman, social media interaction, ex-partner contact, female colleague closeness, she is jealous, he is jealous | Attachment security threat. Jealousy is fear of replacement wearing the mask of anger. The underlying question: "Am I enough for you?" |
| 4 | `her_family_conflict` | Mother-in-law criticism, father-in-law boundary violation, sibling interference, family pressure (children, career, lifestyle), cultural expectation clash | Loyalty bind. She feels caught between her family of origin and her partner, or she needs him to protect her from his own family. Failure to take her side = betrayal. |
| 5 | `financial_disagreement` | Spending habits, hidden purchases, financial priorities mismatch, debt disclosure, support to her family vs. his | Financial conflicts are rarely about money. They are about values, security, and power distribution in the relationship. |
| 6 | `sexual_rejection` | He rejected her, she rejected him, mismatched desire, performance anxiety, body image impact | Sexual rejection activates the same neural pathways as physical pain. For women, rejection often spirals into body image and desirability concerns. For men, it often registers as relational rejection. |
| 7 | `emotional_withdrawal` | He withdrew, she withdrew, post-conflict stonewalling, gradual emotional distance, parallel living | Withdrawal is the most destructive conflict behavior (Gottman's "Four Horsemen"). It signals to the other person: "You are not worth engaging with." |
| 8 | `public_embarrassment` | He said something embarrassing about her publicly, social media post, joke at her expense in front of friends/family, contradicted her publicly | Public humiliation triggers shame, which is the most toxic emotion for relationship safety. Shame says "I am fundamentally flawed," unlike guilt which says "I did something wrong." |
| 9 | `trust_violation` | Broken promise, shared private information, violated a boundary she set, checked her phone, contacted someone she asked him not to | Trust violations compound. Each one does not start from zero -- it stacks on every previous violation. The repair cost increases exponentially with each occurrence. |
| 10 | `repeated_offense` | Any of the above that has happened before, pattern behavior, broken commitment to change | Repeated offenses shift her emotional response from hurt to hopelessness. She is no longer asking "Why did you do this?" but "Will you ever change?" This is the most relationship-threatening category. |

# 2. De-escalation Scripts

## 2.1 Universal De-escalation Structure

Every SOS coaching session follows a 3-phase structure. The phases are sequential but the timing between them is flexible and depends on her readiness signals.

```
Phase 1: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (0-5 minutes)
  Goal: Stop the bleeding. Prevent escalation. Signal safety.
  Mode: Prescriptive ("Say this exactly")

Phase 2: ACTIVE LISTENING (10-30 minutes)
  Goal: Let her be fully heard. Validate her experience.
  Mode: Guided ("Ask this, then listen")

Phase 3: RESOLUTION (When she signals readiness)
  Goal: Acknowledge -> Accountable -> Action Plan
  Mode: Framework ("Follow this structure")
```

**Phase transition signals (how he knows she is ready for the next phase):**

| From Phase | To Phase | She Shows |
|---|---|---|
| 1 -> 2 | Immediate -> Listening | Her voice volume decreases. She makes eye contact. She asks a question. She stops crying and looks at him. She takes a deep breath. |
| 2 -> 3 | Listening -> Resolution | She says "So what are you going to do?" She expresses what she needs. Her body language softens (uncrosses arms, moves closer). She uses "we" language. |

---

## 2.2 De-escalation Scripts by Situation Type

### SITUATION 1: Forgot Anniversary / Important Date

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response (Say This Exactly)**

> "You're right. I forgot, and there is no excuse for that. I'm not going to try to explain it away. You deserve to feel important to me every day, and especially today. I'm sorry."

- **Body language:** Face her directly. Put phone away. Hands visible (not in pockets or crossed). Maintain soft eye contact.
- **Tone:** Serious, not groveling. She needs to see genuine remorse, not theatrical guilt.
- **Do NOT say:** "I've been so busy," "I thought it was next week," "It's just a date," "I'll make it up to you."

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening (10-30 minutes)**

Open questions to ask:
- "Can you tell me what this day means to you? I want to understand."
- "When you realized I forgot, what went through your mind?"
- "Is this part of a pattern that bothers you -- like I don't prioritize us?"

Validation phrases:
- "You're not overreacting. This matters."
- "I hear you -- you need to know that our relationship is a priority, not an afterthought."
- "That makes complete sense. If you forgot something that mattered to me, I'd be hurt too."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "I forgot [specific date]. That made you feel [use her words, not yours]."
2. **Accountable:** "That's on me. Not my schedule, not my workload -- me. I should have had a system to make sure this never happens."
3. **Action Plan:** "Here's what I'm going to do: [specific, concrete, verifiable action]. And I want to make today special starting right now. What would feel right to you?"

---

### SITUATION 2: Caught in a Lie

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "You're right. I wasn't honest with you, and you deserve honesty. I'm not going to defend what I did. I want to tell you the full truth right now, if you're willing to hear it."

- **Body language:** Open posture. Do not look away. Resist every urge to fidget or check your phone. Stillness communicates sincerity.
- **Tone:** Calm and direct. Emotional flooding from him will look like manipulation.
- **Do NOT say:** "It wasn't a big deal," "I was trying to protect you," "You're blowing this out of proportion," "Everyone lies about small things."

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "What hurts most -- what I lied about, or that I lied at all?"
- "What do you need from me right now to feel safe?"
- "Is there anything else you've been wondering about that I should be honest about?"

Validation phrases:
- "You have every right not to trust me right now. Trust is earned, and I broke it."
- "I understand that the lie is bigger than the thing I lied about."
- "Your instincts were right. I should have respected that."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "I lied about [specific thing]. That broke your trust."
2. **Accountable:** "I chose to lie instead of being honest, and that was wrong. The reason doesn't matter -- the choice does."
3. **Action Plan:** "I want to rebuild your trust. That means [specific transparency commitments]. And I understand if it takes time. I'll be patient with that process."

---

### SITUATION 3: Jealousy Issue

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "I can see this is really bothering you, and I don't want to dismiss it. Your feelings about this are important to me. Can we sit down and talk about it?"

- **Body language:** Move toward her, not away. Physical proximity (without crowding) signals that he is not running from the conversation.
- **Tone:** Warm and serious. Not defensive. Not dismissive.
- **Do NOT say:** "You're being jealous," "She's just a friend / colleague," "You have nothing to worry about," "You're being crazy."

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "Help me understand what you saw or felt that triggered this."
- "Is this about this specific situation, or about something deeper you've been feeling?"
- "What would make you feel secure about this?"

Validation phrases:
- "I understand why that looked concerning. I would feel the same way."
- "Your feelings aren't irrational. They're telling you something, and I want to listen."
- "I never want you to question where you stand with me."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "When [specific trigger], you felt [threatened/insecure/disrespected]."
2. **Accountable:** "I should have [been more transparent / set clearer boundaries / told you about it first]. I can see how my behavior contributed to this."
3. **Action Plan:** "Going forward, I will [specific boundary or transparency commitment]. And I want you to tell me anytime something makes you uncomfortable -- I'd rather talk about it than have you sit with it alone."

---

### SITUATION 4: In-Law / Family Conflict

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "I'm on your side. Whatever happened with [family member], I want to hear your perspective first. You come first."

- **Body language:** Sit beside her, not across from her. Same-side positioning communicates alliance.
- **Tone:** Protective, not dismissive of his family. He must navigate this carefully.
- **Do NOT say:** "That's just how my mother is," "You need to be more patient with them," "They didn't mean it that way," "You're too sensitive about family stuff."

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "What did [family member] say or do that hurt you?"
- "How long have you been carrying this? Is this the first time or part of a pattern?"
- "What do you need from me specifically -- do you need me to talk to them, or do you need me to support you while you handle it?"

Validation phrases:
- "You shouldn't have to tolerate disrespect from anyone, including my family."
- "I hear you. This isn't about being oversensitive -- this is about being treated with respect."
- "I'm sorry I haven't stepped in sooner. That's going to change."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "[Family member] crossed a line with you, and I didn't protect you from that."
2. **Accountable:** "I've been avoiding this conflict with my family, and that avoidance hurt you. That stops now."
3. **Action Plan:** "I'm going to [specific action: talk to family member, set boundary, change visitation pattern]. You and I will agree on boundaries together, and I will enforce them."

---

### SITUATION 5: Financial Disagreement

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "I don't want to fight about money. I want us to be on the same team about this. Can we take a breath and talk about what's really bothering each of us?"

- **Body language:** Relaxed posture. No finger-pointing. Side-by-side positioning if possible (looking at the problem together, not at each other as the problem).
- **Tone:** Collaborative, not adversarial. Financial conflict triggers survival anxiety.
- **Do NOT say:** "It's my money," "You spend too much," "We can't afford that because of you," "My family never had these problems."

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "When you think about our finances, what worries you most?"
- "What does financial security look like for you? I want to understand your picture."
- "Is this about this specific purchase, or about how we make financial decisions together?"

Validation phrases:
- "Your concerns about money are valid. This affects both of us."
- "I understand that financial stability means safety to you, and I want you to feel safe."
- "We have different approaches to money, and neither one is wrong. We need to find our approach."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "We disagreed about [specific issue]. This isn't just about dollars -- it's about feeling secure and respected in how we make decisions."
2. **Accountable:** "I [made a unilateral decision / hid a purchase / dismissed your concerns], and that wasn't fair."
3. **Action Plan:** "Let's set up a monthly finance conversation -- 30 minutes, no judgment. We agree on a budget together and both have input."

---

### SITUATION 6: Sexual Rejection

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

If he rejected her:
> "Hey -- I want you to know this has nothing to do with how I see you or how attracted I am to you. You are beautiful. I'm just [tired/stressed/not in the right headspace], and I want our intimacy to be good for both of us."

If she rejected him:
> "That's completely okay. No pressure, ever. Come here -- let's just be close."

- **Body language:** Physical closeness without sexual pressure. Holding, not groping. Hand on back or arm, not waist or thigh.
- **Tone:** Warm, gentle, zero resentment.
- **Do NOT say (if she rejected him):** "Fine," "Again?," "You never want to," "Is something wrong with you?" or any phrase that communicates punishment for her no.
- **Do NOT say (if he rejected her):** "I'm just not in the mood" (without reassurance), "Maybe if you..." (conditional desire).

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions (use only when both are calm, not in the moment):
- "I want to make sure we're both happy with our intimacy. How are you feeling about us in that area?"
- "Is there anything I could do differently that would make you feel more desired / comfortable / connected?"

Validation phrases:
- "Your desire matters to me. I never want you to feel rejected."
- "Intimacy isn't just about sex for me -- it's about being close to you in every way."
- "We can figure this out together. There's no pressure or timeline."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

Not a single conversation but an ongoing dialogue. The action plan should include:
- Scheduled non-sexual physical intimacy (rebuilds touch without pressure).
- Open communication channel: "Either of us can say 'not tonight' without it being a big deal."
- If pattern persists beyond 4 weeks, gentle suggestion to explore together (couples counseling, not medical).

---

### SITUATION 7: Emotional Withdrawal

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "I've noticed we've felt distant lately, and I miss you. I don't want to pretend everything is fine. Can we talk about what's going on between us?"

- **Body language:** Approach gently. Do not ambush. Choose a moment when she is not occupied with tasks.
- **Tone:** Vulnerable, not accusatory. "I miss you" is disarming. "Why have you been distant?" is attacking.
- **Do NOT say:** "What's wrong with you lately?," "You've been weird," "Are you punishing me?," "Why won't you talk to me?"

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "When did things start feeling different for you?"
- "Is there something I did that pushed you away?"
- "What do you need from me that you're not getting?"

Validation phrases:
- "I hear you. I've been so focused on [work/other] that I stopped paying attention to us. That's not okay."
- "You shouldn't have to fight for my attention. You should just have it."
- "Thank you for telling me. I know it took courage to say that."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "We've been emotionally disconnected, and I contributed to that."
2. **Accountable:** "I [specific behavior: stopped asking about your day, spent every evening on my phone, stopped initiating affection]."
3. **Action Plan:** "Starting this week, I want to [one specific, measurable commitment]. And I want us to check in every [timeframe] to make sure we're staying connected."

---

### SITUATION 8: Public Embarrassment

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "I am so sorry. What I said / did was wrong, and you didn't deserve that. I should never make you feel small, especially not in front of other people."

- **Body language:** If still in public, subtly move to a private space. Do not continue the conversation in front of the audience. In private, full physical attention -- face her, no distractions.
- **Tone:** Serious, contrite. This is not a "lighten up" moment.
- **Do NOT say:** "It was just a joke," "You're overreacting," "Everyone laughed," "I didn't mean it like that," "You're embarrassing me by being upset."

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "How did that make you feel in the moment? I need to understand what I put you through."
- "Was this a one-time thing for you, or have I done this before without realizing?"
- "What do you need from me to feel safe in social situations with me again?"

Validation phrases:
- "You have every right to be angry. I humiliated you, and that's not okay."
- "Your dignity is not a punchline. I should know that."
- "I understand if you don't want to go out together for a while. I broke your trust in public."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "I embarrassed you in front of [specific people] by [specific action]. That was disrespectful."
2. **Accountable:** "I did that because [honest reason -- trying to be funny, insecurity, showing off]. None of those reasons justify it."
3. **Action Plan:** "If I catch myself doing anything like that again, I'll stop immediately and correct myself. And if you notice before I do, give me a signal and I'll redirect. I also want to apologize to you in front of the people who were there, if you'd like that."

---

### SITUATION 9: Trust Violation

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "I broke your trust. I'm not going to justify it or explain it away. You have every right to be upset. I want to hear how you're feeling."

- **Body language:** Still. Open. Absorb. Do not look away from the pain.
- **Tone:** Somber and steady. Emotional flooding from him will feel like he is making it about himself.
- **Do NOT say:** "You're overreacting," "It's not like I cheated," "Everyone does this," "I won't do it again" (premature -- she hasn't asked for a commitment yet).

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "What was the moment you realized I'd broken your trust?"
- "Is this reminding you of other times I let you down?"
- "What does rebuilding trust look like for you? I don't want to assume."

Validation phrases:
- "Trust is everything, and I damaged it. You have every right to be guarded now."
- "I don't get to decide when you trust me again. That's your timeline."
- "Each time I break trust, it gets harder to rebuild. I understand the weight of that."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "I [specific violation]. That was a betrayal of your trust."
2. **Accountable:** "I'm not going to say 'I didn't think it was a big deal.' It was a big deal because trust is a big deal."
3. **Action Plan:** "I want to earn your trust back through consistent behavior, not words. Here is what I commit to: [specific, measurable actions]. And I want you to hold me accountable -- if you need to check, ask, or verify, that's okay for as long as you need."

---

### SITUATION 10: Repeated Offense

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Response**

> "I know. I said I wouldn't do this again, and I did. You have every right to feel like my promises mean nothing. I'm not going to make another promise right now -- I want to listen first."

- **Body language:** Ground yourself. This is the hardest conversation because she may have reached her limit. Sit down. Be still. Prepare to hear the worst.
- **Tone:** Humble. Not defensive. Not pleading. She does not need his performance of guilt; she needs evidence that he understands the pattern.
- **Do NOT say:** "I'm trying," "These things take time," "I'm not perfect," "At least I [unrelated positive behavior]."

**Phase 2 -- Active Listening**

Open questions:
- "What is it like for you to watch this happen again?"
- "Do you still believe I can change? I need to hear your honest answer."
- "What would be different this time that would actually make you feel safe?"

Validation phrases:
- "I understand why you don't believe me anymore. I've given you reasons not to."
- "Your patience is not unlimited, and I've been spending it like it is."
- "If the roles were reversed, I wouldn't trust me either right now."

**Phase 3 -- Resolution**

1. **Acknowledge:** "This is the [number]th time I've [behavior]. The pattern is real, and I can't pretend it's not."
2. **Accountable:** "Saying 'I'll change' without actually changing is its own form of dishonesty. I recognize that."
3. **Action Plan:** "I think I need help with this -- [professional support, habit-change system, accountability partner]. Words aren't enough anymore. Would you be willing to see what I do over the next [timeframe] before I ask you to believe me again?"

## 2.3 Behavioral Response Protocols

When she responds in unexpected ways, the AI must coach through these scenarios:

### If She Won't Engage

**What's Happening:** She has decided that engaging is not worth the emotional cost, or she needs more time.

**Coaching Script:**
> "She's not ready to talk, and that's okay. Here's what to do: Say 'I understand you need space. I'm not going anywhere. When you're ready, I'll be here.' Then physically stay nearby but don't hover. Don't leave the house. Don't go to a different room and start watching TV. Be visibly available without being intrusive."

**Timing:** Check back in 30-60 minutes with a gentle, non-verbal bid -- bring her water, sit near her, or leave a brief note.

### If She Walks Away

**What's Happening:** She is overwhelmed and needs to physically remove herself from the emotional stimulus (him).

**Coaching Script:**
> "Let her go. Do NOT follow her. Say 'I'm here when you're ready' as she leaves. Wait. Do not text her 15 messages. Send ONE message after 20-30 minutes: 'I love you. I'm ready to listen whenever you are. No rush.' Then wait."

### If She Cries

**What's Happening:** Crying is emotional release, not manipulation. Her nervous system is discharging overwhelm.

**Coaching Script:**
> "Go to her. Don't ask 'Why are you crying?' -- she may not know, or the reason is obvious. Instead: sit next to her, put your arm around her if she doesn't pull away, and say 'I'm right here. You don't have to explain anything.' Let her cry. Do not try to stop the crying. Do not say 'Don't cry.' Crying needs to run its course. Your job is presence, not repair. The repair comes later."

### If She Yells

**What's Happening:** Yelling is anger's way of trying to be heard. She believes normal volume is not reaching him.

**Coaching Script:**
> "Do NOT yell back. Do not match her volume. Lower your voice -- this is counterintuitive but it forces her nervous system to recalibrate. Speak slowly and softly: 'I hear you. I can see how angry you are, and I want to understand. I'm listening.' If the yelling continues for more than 5 minutes without any pause, say: 'I want to hear everything you need to say. Can I sit down and really listen?' The act of sitting down de-escalates by removing the physical posture of confrontation."

# 3. Emotional State Modifiers

## 3.1 Menstrual Phase Modifiers

The SOS coaching adapts based on the woman's current cycle phase. These modifiers are applied on top of the standard de-escalation scripts.

| Cycle Phase | Modifier to SOS Coaching | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Follicular (Days 6-13)** | Standard coaching. She has higher emotional resilience and conflict tolerance. Resolution conversations are more productive in this phase. | Rising estrogen improves mood stability, cognitive flexibility, and communication willingness. |
| **Ovulation (Days 14-16)** | Standard coaching. She may be more assertive in expressing her needs, which is healthy. Coach him to match her directness with openness. | Peak estrogen and testosterone increase confidence and verbal fluency. She may be clearer about what she needs. |
| **Early Luteal (Days 17-22)** | Increase gentleness by 20%. Add more validation phrases. Reduce pressure to resolve quickly. | Progesterone is rising, beginning to reduce emotional flexibility. She is more inward-focused. |
| **Late Luteal (Days 23-28)** | Maximum patience. No minimizing. Extra physical comfort suggestions. Delay resolution conversations by 24-48 hours if possible. Never reference her cycle as a cause. | Progesterone and estrogen are crashing. Serotonin sensitivity drops. She is neurochemically primed for emotional pain and irritability. This is NOT her overreacting -- this is her nervous system under hormonal stress. |
| **Menstruation (Days 1-5)** | Add physical comfort coaching (pain awareness). Reduce expectations for emotional processing. Lead with acts of service. | Physical pain reduces emotional bandwidth. She may be irritable from pain, not from the conflict itself. |

**Critical Rule:** The AI must NEVER say or imply: "She's probably upset because of her period/PMS/hormones." Even if the cycle phase is a contributing factor, attributing her emotions to her biology is invalidating and harmful. The coaching acknowledges the biological context internally (by adjusting tone and timing) but externally treats her emotions as fully valid regardless of cause.

---

## 3.2 Pregnancy Modifiers

| Trimester | SOS Coaching Modifier |
|---|---|
| **T1 (Weeks 1-12)** | She may be nauseous, exhausted, and emotionally volatile due to HCG surge. Coaching must: (1) Never suggest food-related gestures during active nausea. (2) Shorten coaching sessions -- her energy is extremely limited. (3) Emphasize that her emotional responses are amplified but valid. (4) Coach him to take over ALL household tasks without being asked. (5) Add: "She may cry more easily right now. That is not weakness; it is her body processing enormous change." |
| **T2 (Weeks 13-26)** | Energy returns but body changes accelerate. She may feel self-conscious. Coaching must: (1) Emphasize body-positive language. (2) Include reassurance of attraction and desire. (3) Be aware of nesting instincts -- she may be anxious about preparation. (4) Coach him to engage actively in pregnancy planning. |
| **T3 (Weeks 27-40)** | Physical discomfort dominates. Anxiety about birth and parenthood is high. Coaching must: (1) Lead with physical comfort actions (back rubs, positioning pillows, getting things from high shelves). (2) Never minimize birth anxiety -- it is existential. (3) Coach him to be present and informed (know her birth plan, hospital route, bag status). (4) Shorten all conversations -- she cannot sustain long discussions comfortably. (5) Add: "Anything she is angry about right now has the weight of 'I am about to bring a life into the world and I need to know I can count on you.'" |

---

## 3.3 Postpartum Modifiers

| Postpartum Window | SOS Coaching Modifier |
|---|---|
| **0-2 weeks** | Hormonal crash (estrogen and progesterone drop 90% within 48 hours of delivery). Physical recovery from birth. Coaching must: (1) Eliminate any expectations of her. Zero demands. (2) Coach him to handle everything he can without asking. (3) Watch for PPD red flags (see Section 10). (4) Never say "you should be happy." (5) Her anger may be disproportionate -- validate it fully. |
| **2-6 weeks** | Sleep deprivation accumulates. Identity shift accelerates. She may grieve her pre-baby self. Coaching must: (1) Normalize her feelings, including ambivalence about motherhood. (2) Coach him to provide uninterrupted sleep blocks (take the baby for a 4-hour stretch). (3) Any conflict resolution must be extremely brief -- her cognitive load is maximal. (4) Monitor for statements of hopelessness or inadequacy. |
| **6 weeks - 6 months** | She may be returning to work. Guilt about leaving the baby. Body not yet "back." Coaching must: (1) Never comment on her body's recovery timeline. (2) Validate work-vs-motherhood tension without taking sides. (3) Coach him to proactively manage childcare logistics. (4) Watch for: "The baby would be better off without me" (immediate crisis escalation). |
| **6-12 months** | New normal is forming. Relationship must be actively rebuilt. Coaching must: (1) Emphasize couple identity beyond parenting. (2) Coach date nights and couple time. (3) Address any resentment that has built up during the postpartum period. (4) Continue PPD monitoring -- onset can occur up to 12 months postpartum. |

**Absolute Postpartum Rule:** The AI must NEVER say, imply, or coach language that sounds like: "You're overreacting," "Other mothers manage fine," "You should be grateful," "The baby needs a happy mom" (weaponizing the baby against her mental state). These phrases cause documented harm to postpartum women.

---

## 3.4 Menopause Modifiers

| Menopause Stage | SOS Coaching Modifier |
|---|---|
| **Perimenopause (varies, typically 45-55)** | Irregular hormonal fluctuations. Hot flashes, sleep disruption, mood swings that may be more severe than PMS. Coaching must: (1) Validate physical symptoms as real and impactful. (2) Never attribute emotional responses solely to menopause. (3) Coach him to educate himself about what she is experiencing. (4) Increase comfort-focused suggestions (temperature control, sleep support). (5) Recognize that she may feel invisible or aging -- reassurance of attraction is critical but must be genuine, not patronizing. |
| **Menopause (12 months post last period)** | Hormonal stabilization but at new baseline. Possible mood changes, low libido, body confidence shifts. Coaching must: (1) Respect that her relationship with her body is changing. (2) Never connect her emotional state to "the change" dismissively. (3) Intimacy coaching must be sensitive to potential physical changes (dryness, discomfort). (4) Suggest professional support for symptom management if she raises it (never proactively diagnose). |

# 4. Safety Guardrails

## 4.1 When to Stop Coaching and Suggest Professional Help

The AI must transition from coaching to professional referral when any of the following thresholds are crossed. This is not optional.

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Severity score reaches 5 (Critical) | Immediately display crisis resources. Continue supportive messaging to the partner but disclaim therapeutic role. |
| Self-harm or suicidal language detected (any language) | Severity override to 5. Display crisis hotline. One-tap call button. Log event. |
| Partner describes physical violence (either direction) | Stop relationship coaching. Display domestic violence resources. Do NOT coach de-escalation of physical violence -- safety first. |
| Situation has persisted unchanged for 2+ weeks despite coaching | Suggest couples counseling as a positive step, not a failure signal. |
| Partner describes her experiencing hallucinations, delusions, or severe confusion | Immediate medical referral. Possible postpartum psychosis if within 12 months of birth. |
| Three or more SOS sessions in 7 days for the same issue | Pattern alert. Suggest professional support: "This pattern suggests you both could benefit from professional guidance." |
| He expresses his own suicidal ideation or self-harm | Switch to HIS safety immediately. Display men's crisis resources. |

---

## 4.2 Abuse Detection Indicators

The AI must monitor for abuse indicators in **both directions** without making accusations. Detection triggers resource display, not judgment.

### Indicators That She May Be Experiencing Abuse

| Signal in His Language | Possible Indicator | AI Action |
|---|---|---|
| "She made me angry so I..." | Blame-shifting for his aggressive behavior | Monitor pattern. If physical aggression implied, display DV resources for her. |
| "I need to know where she is at all times" | Controlling behavior | Do NOT coach surveillance. Suggest trust-building instead. Flag if persistent. |
| "She's not allowed to..." | Controlling access to autonomy | Do NOT validate. Redirect to healthy boundary discussion. Flag. |
| "I check her phone because..." | Privacy violation as control | Coach against this. Suggest transparent communication instead. |
| Repeated descriptions of her "fear" of him | Intimidation pattern | Display DV resources. Modify coaching to prioritize her safety. |

### Indicators That He May Be Experiencing Abuse

| Signal in His Language | Possible Indicator | AI Action |
|---|---|---|
| "She hits me / throws things at me" | Physical abuse toward him | Validate his experience. Display men's DV resources. Do NOT minimize male victimhood. |
| "She threatens to [false accusation / take children / destroy property]" | Coercive control by her | Suggest professional legal and psychological support. |
| "She isolates me from my friends/family" | Social isolation as control | Acknowledge this as unhealthy. Suggest counseling. |
| "If I try to leave, she threatens to hurt herself" | Emotional hostage-taking | This is abusive behavior. He is not responsible for her self-harm threats. Suggest professional intervention for both. |

**Critical Protocol:** LOLO is not a domestic violence intervention tool. When abuse is detected, the app provides resources and exits the coaching role. It does not attempt to mediate abusive dynamics.

---

## 4.3 Self-Harm Language Detection

The safety scanner must detect self-harm and suicidal language across all three supported languages. Detection triggers immediate Severity 5 escalation.

### English Detection Patterns

| Category | Phrases / Patterns |
|---|---|
| Direct | "kill myself," "end my life," "want to die," "better off dead," "suicide," "suicidal" |
| Indirect | "can't go on," "no point in living," "everyone would be better off without me," "want to disappear," "want it all to stop," "can't take it anymore" |
| Postpartum-specific | "the baby would be better off without me," "I'm a terrible mother," "I can't do this anymore" (in postpartum context), "I want to hurt the baby" (immediate crisis) |
| Partner reporting | "she said she wants to die," "she's talking about killing herself," "I found [pills/items] she was hiding," "she's hurting herself" |

### Arabic Detection Patterns (with transliteration)

| Category | Arabic Phrase | Transliteration | English Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Direct | ابي اموت | abi amut | I want to die |
| Direct | ابي انتحر | abi antahir | I want to kill myself |

| Postpartum | البيبي أحسن بدوني | al-baby ahsan biduni | The baby is better without me |
| Postpartum | ما اقدر اكون ام | ma agdar akun um | I can't be a mother |

### Malay Detection Patterns

| Category | Malay Phrase | English Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Direct | Saya nak mati | I want to die |
| Direct | Saya nak bunuh diri | I want to kill myself |
| Indirect | Tak tahan lagi | Can't take it anymore |

# 5. Cross-Cultural SOS Adaptations

## 5.1 Arabic Cultural Adaptations

### Family Honor Dynamics

In Gulf Arab and broader MENA cultures, relationship conflicts intersect with family honor ('ird / عرض) in ways that fundamentally alter the dynamics:

| Dynamic | Impact on SOS Coaching |
|---|---|
| **Conflict is private.** Airing marital problems is seen as dishonorable to both families. | The AI must never suggest "talk to a friend about this" as a first option. Frame professional support as private and confidential. Normalize it with: "Many couples in the region work with counselors privately." |
| **His family may be involved.** Her mother-in-law may have significant influence or authority over household decisions. | In-law conflicts require the husband to mediate, not her. Coach HIM to speak to his family, never coach her to confront them directly. |
| **Her family may intervene.** If she tells her family, the conflict escalates by an order of magnitude. | Coach urgency: "Resolve this before it reaches the families, because once families are involved, it becomes about honor, not about the two of you." |
| **Divorce stigma is high (but changing).** She may tolerate more than she should because of social consequences. | The AI must never coach her to "just leave" or frame divorce as empowerment. Instead, ensure she has access to support resources and let her make informed decisions. |
| **Male apology is culturally difficult.** Admitting fault publicly is a loss of face for men. | Frame apology as strength and Islamic virtue: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) was the most generous in apologizing to his wives." Private apology is more culturally feasible than public acknowledgment. |

### In-Law Mediation Norms

| Norm | Coaching Adaptation |
|---|---|
| The mother-in-law often lives nearby or in the same household | Coach boundary-setting that respects the mother's role while protecting his wife's autonomy: "Your mother is important, and so is your wife's comfort in her own home." |
| Elder women may mediate conflicts | When appropriate, suggest involving a respected elder woman (grandmother, aunt) as mediator -- this is culturally normative and can be effective. |
| His sister may be an ally or a rival | Coach him to assess whether involving his sister would help or harm. In many families, the sister-in-law dynamic is competitive. |

### Islamic Reconciliation Framework

| Principle | Application in SOS Coaching |
|---|---|
| **Sakeenah (tranquility in marriage)** | Frame the goal of conflict resolution as restoring sakeenah, not "winning." |
| **Mawaddah wa Rahmah (love and mercy)** | Remind him that the Quranic framework for marriage is love AND mercy -- mercy is what is needed when love is strained. |
| **Shura (consultation)** | Decisions should be made together, not imposed. Coach collaborative language. |
| **Sabr (patience)** | Patience is a virtue, but it should not be weaponized: "Be patient" should not mean "tolerate mistreatment." |
| **Seeking reconciliation before escalation** | Islamic jurisprudence encourages reconciliation steps before separation. The AI can reference this cultural value as motivation for repair. |

---

## 5.2 Malay Cultural Adaptations

### Face-Saving Communication

| Concept | Impact on SOS Coaching |
|---|---|
| **Jaga maruah (protect dignity)** | Conflict resolution must never require either partner to "lose face." Frame apologies as strength, not submission. Avoid public discussions of the conflict. |
| **Budi bahasa (courtesy and refinement)** | Direct confrontation is culturally jarring. Coach him to use indirect, gentle language even when addressing serious issues. |
| **Malu (shame/embarrassment)** | She may not express anger directly because of cultural expectations of female composure. Silence or withdrawal may be her primary conflict response. Coach him to read these signals as significant. |
| **Sabar (patience/endurance)** | Both partners may suppress conflict for extended periods, leading to explosive eruptions. The AI should coach proactive check-ins to prevent accumulation. |

### Elder Involvement

| Scenario | Coaching Adaptation |
|---|---|
| Her parents are involved or informed | In Malay culture, parents maintain significant influence post-marriage. Coach him to respect her parents' involvement while maintaining the couple's decision-making autonomy. |
| Tok Imam or religious leader is consulted | Religious mediation is common and can be effective. The AI can suggest this as an option: "Would it help to speak with a trusted religious advisor together?" |
| Community perception matters | Coach private resolution. Avoid suggestions that create public visibility of the conflict. |

### Islamic Counseling Integration

| Element | Application |
|---|---|
| **Solat hajat (prayer for guidance)** | For religiously observant couples, suggesting joint prayer before difficult conversations is culturally appropriate and can provide emotional grounding. |
| **Doa (supplication)** | Coach him to make doa for their relationship. This is a genuine expression of care in Islamic Malay culture, not a substitute for action. |
| **Taubat (repentance)** | For acknowledged wrongdoing, the concept of sincere repentance (acknowledging wrong, feeling genuine remorse, committing to change) maps directly onto clinical repair frameworks. |
| **Nikah renewal ceremony** | For serious trust violations or near-separation, some couples find renewal of vows (tajdid nikah) meaningful. This can be suggested as a long-term action for severe situations. |

# DELIVERABLE 2: PREGNANCY MODULE

---

# 6. Trimester-by-Trimester Guide

## 6.1 First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)

### Physical Reality

| Symptom | Prevalence | Impact on Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Nausea / morning sickness | 70-80% of pregnancies | She may be unable to eat, cook, or tolerate food smells. He must take over kitchen duties without being asked. |
| Extreme fatigue | Nearly universal | She is growing a placenta from scratch. Her exhaustion is not laziness. She may sleep 12+ hours and still feel tired. |
| Breast tenderness | Very common | Physical intimacy may be uncomfortable. He should not initiate touch in sensitive areas without checking. |
| Food aversions | Very common | Foods she loved may now disgust her. Do NOT ask "But you used to love that?" |
| Frequent urination | Common | Disrupts sleep, adds to fatigue. No jokes. |
| Heightened sense of smell | Common | Certain scents (cologne, cooking, cleaning products) may trigger nausea. Adjust the environment. |

### Emotional Landscape

- **Hormonal driver:** HCG doubles every 48-72 hours. Progesterone surges. Estrogen rises. This is the most dramatic hormonal shift in a woman's life.
- **Mood profile:** Unpredictable. She may swing from elated (we're having a baby!) to terrified (how will we manage?) to resentful (why don't I feel happy?) within an hour.
- **Anxiety themes:** Miscarriage fear (highest risk period), genetic concerns, financial readiness, career impact, body autonomy loss, relationship change.
- **Identity shift begins:** She is becoming a mother. This is an existential transition, not just a physical one.

### AI Message Tone

- **Primary tone:** Gentle, patient, no pressure.
- **Energy level:** Low. Match her fatigue.
- **Content restrictions:** No food talk unless she initiates. No images of food. No restaurant suggestions. No "you should eat more."
- **Avoid:** Excitement that outpaces her own. She may not feel excited yet, and that is normal. Do not make her perform happiness.

### What He Should Know

1. She may not have told anyone yet. She is carrying this secret alone or with him only. The isolation is real.
2. Miscarriage risk is highest now (15-20% of known pregnancies). She may be holding her breath for 12 weeks.
3. She may resent him for not being physically affected. His body continues as normal while hers is under siege. Acknowledge this disparity.
4. She needs him to educate himself independently. "Read the app, read the book, ask the doctor questions. Don't make me teach you how to support me while I'm busy building a human."

---

## 6.2 Second Trimester (Weeks 13-26)

### Physical Reality

| Symptom | Prevalence | Impact on Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Nausea subsides | Most women | Energy returns. She may feel "herself" again. This is the "golden trimester." |
| Visible belly | Universal | She becomes visibly pregnant. Body image feelings intensify -- some women love it, some struggle. Follow HER lead. |
| Baby movement begins (quickening) | 16-25 weeks | Profound bonding moment. He should ask to feel the baby kick, share the experience. |
| Increased appetite | Common | She may have cravings. Honor them without judgment. |
| Round ligament pain | Common | Sharp abdominal pains from uterus growth. Uncomfortable but normal. |
| Skin changes | Variable | Stretch marks, linea nigra, "pregnancy glow" or acne. Do NOT comment unless it is a compliment. |

### Emotional Landscape

- **Hormonal driver:** Estrogen and progesterone stabilize at elevated levels. HCG drops. Emotional volatility decreases.
- **Mood profile:** Generally improved. More stable. Optimism about the pregnancy increases.
- **Anxiety themes shift:** Body changes, weight gain, relationship with her own mother (will she be like her?), birth planning begins.
- **Nesting instinct begins:** She may become preoccupied with preparing the home. This is biological, not irrational. Help her.
- **Sexual desire:** May increase significantly in T2 due to increased blood flow and estrogen. She may feel more desire than usual but also self-conscious about her changing body. Let her lead.

### AI Message Tone

- **Primary tone:** Supportive, celebratory, body-positive.
- **Energy level:** Medium-high. Match her returning energy.
- **Content opportunities:** Nursery planning, baby name discussions, couple activities before the baby arrives.
- **Avoid:** Comments about weight or body size, even "positive" ones like "You're so big!" Also avoid "Enjoy this time while you can" (implies the future will be worse).

### What He Should Know

1. The anatomy scan (18-22 weeks) is a major emotional event. Be present for it. Do NOT miss this appointment.
2. She may want to discuss names, nursery design, and birth plans extensively. Engage with genuine interest, not tolerance.
3. Her body confidence may need active reinforcement. "You've never been more beautiful" must be said with conviction, not obligation.
4. This is the best trimester for couple activities -- travel (babymoon), date nights, intimacy. Invest in the relationship now.

---

## 6.3 Third Trimester (Weeks 27-40)

### Physical Reality

| Symptom | Prevalence | Impact on Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Significant discomfort | Universal | Back pain, pelvic pressure, difficulty sleeping, shortness of breath. She cannot get comfortable. |
| Braxton Hicks contractions | Common from 28+ weeks | Practice contractions that are uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing. |
| Swelling (edema) | Very common | Feet, ankles, hands. She may not fit into her shoes. |
| Heartburn | Very common | Lying down makes it worse. Sleep is already compromised. |
| Frequent urination (returns) | Universal | Baby is pressing on her bladder. She may need to urinate every 30-60 minutes. |
| Difficulty with mobility | Progressive | Bending, standing up, climbing stairs become challenging. |

### Emotional Landscape

- **Hormonal driver:** Cortisol rises (preparing for birth). Estrogen and progesterone at peak levels. Oxytocin receptor sensitivity increases (bonding preparation).
- **Mood profile:** Anxious, impatient, uncomfortable, alternating with deep bonding and anticipation.
- **Anxiety themes:** Birth fear (pain, complications, death), readiness as a mother, partner's readiness as a father, financial security, loss of independence, the relationship changing permanently.
- **Nesting peaks:** She may become intensely focused on preparation. Resistance or dismissal of this instinct feels like a threat to the baby's safety in her mind.

### AI Message Tone

- **Primary tone:** Reassuring, practical, presence-focused.
- **Energy level:** Calm. She is tired of "being pregnant." Match her fatigue with steadiness.
- **Content focus:** Practical support, birth preparation, emotional reassurance.
- **Avoid:** "Any day now!" (she knows), "You look ready to pop" (she does not find this charming), "Get sleep now while you can" (she cannot sleep -- her bladder wakes her every hour).

### What He Should Know

1. She is scared. Even women who have done this before are scared. Birth is the single most physically intense experience a human body undergoes. Do not minimize it.
2. She needs him to be prepared. Know the hospital bag contents. Know the route. Know her birth plan. Know the emergency contacts. Do NOT say "We'll figure it out when we get there."
3. Physical presence matters more than words right now. Sit with her. Rub her feet. Help her get up from the couch. These small acts say "I see what your body is going through."
4. She may be irritable about everything. The discomfort is constant and inescapable. Absorb it without reacting.
5. The "last days" before birth are psychologically intense. She is between two worlds -- the life she knows and the life about to begin. Be her anchor.

---

## 6.4 Postpartum (0-12 Months)

### Sub-Phase: Immediate Postpartum (0-2 Weeks)

**Physical reality:** Recovery from birth (vaginal tear healing or C-section incision), bleeding (lochia), breast engorgement, milk coming in, possible infection risk.

**Emotional landscape:** "Baby blues" affect 80% of women (tearfulness, mood swings, irritability). Hormonal crash is the steepest of her life. She may feel euphoric one hour and devastated the next. She is learning to keep a human alive while her body heals from a major physical event.

**AI tone:** Extremely gentle. Acknowledgment-focused. Help-offering.

### Sub-Phase: Early Postpartum (2-6 Weeks)

**Physical reality:** Healing continues. Sleep deprivation accumulates to dangerous levels. Breastfeeding challenges (latching, supply, pain) cause significant distress. First postpartum checkup.

**Emotional landscape:** If "baby blues" resolve by 2-3 weeks, normal adjustment. If they persist or intensify beyond 2 weeks, PPD risk increases significantly. Identity crisis deepens: "Who am I now?"

**AI tone:** Patient, normalizing, help-offering without being patronizing. Validate ambivalent feelings.

### Sub-Phase: Adjustment (6 Weeks - 6 Months)

**Physical reality:** Body is healing but not "back." She may return to work. Breastfeeding may continue and adds logistical complexity. Hormones begin stabilizing but remain different from pre-pregnancy baseline.

**Emotional landscape:** Guilt (working mother guilt OR stay-at-home guilt -- there is no guilt-free option). Relationship strain from sleep deprivation and reduced couple time. She may feel "touched out" from constant physical contact with the baby and reject partner's touch.

**AI tone:** Empathetic, couple-focused. Reintroduce relationship-building messaging.

### Sub-Phase: New Normal (6-12 Months)

**Physical reality:** Body has largely healed. Menstruation may return (especially if not breastfeeding). Physical energy improves but remains lower than pre-pregnancy baseline.

**Emotional landscape:** Identity integration. She is learning to be both herself and a mother. Relationship needs active rebuilding. Resentment may have accumulated if he did not step up. Sexual relationship may need renegotiation.

**AI tone:** Balanced. Celebrate milestones. Address relationship repair. PPD monitoring continues through 12 months.

# 9. Cultural Pregnancy Norms

## 9.1 Arabic Pregnancy Norms

### Gender Reveal Traditions

| Aspect | Details | AI Coaching Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| **Gender preference pressure** | Some families strongly prefer a boy, especially for the first child. This creates enormous pressure on the mother. | The AI must NEVER suggest or reinforce gender preference. If the user expresses disappointment about gender, coach empathy: "She might be carrying the weight of family expectations. Tell her: 'I'm grateful for a healthy baby, and I'm grateful for you.'" |
| **Gender reveal events** | Increasingly common among younger Gulf couples, adopted from Western social media. | Support planning but do not assume preference. |
| **Superstitions about gender prediction** | Belly shape, cravings, skin changes are culturally associated with gender. | Do not reinforce pseudoscience. Do not dismiss cultural beliefs harshly. Simply focus coaching on the baby's health. |

### Postpartum (An-Nifas / النفاس)

| Practice | Details | AI Coaching Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| **40-day rest period** | The mother is expected to rest for 40 days after birth. She is cared for by her mother, mother-in-law, or hired help. | Fully support this tradition. Coach him to ensure the support system is in place. His role may be provider and emotional support rather than primary caretaker during this period. |
| **Family involvement is intensive** | Her mother or his mother may move in. Visitors are frequent and culturally expected. | Coach him to be the buffer between her and overwhelming visitors if needed. In Arab culture, turning visitors away is difficult. He can manage timing and duration. |
| **Special postpartum foods** | Traditional soups, dates, fenugreek (hilba), specific warming foods. | Do not question traditional foods. They carry deep cultural significance and many have actual nutritional merit. |
| **Religious practices** | Adhan (call to prayer) in the baby's ear, aqeeqah (sacrifice on the 7th day), naming ceremony. | Coach him to participate actively in these rituals. They are bonding moments for the family. |

### Family Involvement Expectations

| Expectation | Coaching Approach |
|---|---|
| Her mother may take charge of the newborn care | This is normal. Coach him to support this dynamic while maintaining his bond with the baby. Do not frame it as "she doesn't trust me." |
| His mother may have opinions on parenting | Coach boundary-setting that is respectful: "Thank you Mama, we'll consider that" rather than confrontation. |
| Gifts and gold for the baby are culturally significant | Coach him to facilitate this tradition. It is an expression of family love. |

---

## 9.2 Malay Pregnancy Norms

### Pantang Larang (Postpartum Restrictions)

| Practice | Details | AI Coaching Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| **Pantang period (30-44 days)** | The mother follows dietary and behavioral restrictions after birth. She may avoid certain foods (cold foods, seafood, some fruits), limit bathing to warm/herbal baths, and stay indoors. | NEVER dismiss pantang practices. They are deeply embedded in Malay culture and have generational significance. Coach: "Respect her practices. Even if you don't understand the reasoning, your support matters." |
| **Bidan (traditional midwife) post-birth massage** | A traditional midwife may provide postpartum massage, herbal treatments, and belly binding (bengkung). | Support this practice. It provides physical comfort and cultural continuity. Offer to arrange and pay for the bidan. |
| **Tungku (heating treatment)** | A heated stone or compress applied to the abdomen. Believed to help the uterus contract and heal. | Do not dismiss. Ensure it is done safely. If she wants it, facilitate it. |
| **Herbal baths and jamu** | Traditional herbal preparations for bathing and drinking during confinement. | Respect. Do not suggest they are unnecessary or "unscientific." Her mother and grandmother used them. |

### Confinement Period

| Aspect | Coaching Adaptation |
|---|---|
| Her mother typically manages the confinement | Coach him to support his mother-in-law's role graciously. Help with logistics (groceries, supplies). |
| Confinement lady (paid helper) may be hired | Normalize this. It is a significant investment that shows care. Offer to find and hire one if financially feasible. |
| He may feel sidelined | Validate his feelings but coach patience: "Your wife needs this support system. Your turn to be the primary comes next. Right now, be the provider and the emotional anchor." |
| Food during confinement is specific | Respect the dietary restrictions. Do not bring her food that violates pantang without asking. |

### Traditional Remedies Respect

| Principle | Application |
|---|---|
| Do not replace traditional remedies with medical opinions | The AI must never say "That traditional practice doesn't work." Instead, if there is a medical concern, suggest: "You might want to mention this to the doctor at the next visit, just to make sure everything is safe together." |
| Honor the grandmother's knowledge | The knowledge passed from mother to daughter about pregnancy and postpartum care has centuries of cultural wisdom. Do not position modern medicine as superior to traditional care unless there is a genuine safety concern. |
| Integration, not replacement | The best approach combines modern prenatal care with respected traditional practices. Coach this integration without hierarchy. |

# 10. Warning Signs Framework

## 10.1 Baby Blues vs. Postpartum Depression (PPD)

| Dimension | Baby Blues | Postpartum Depression |
|---|---|---|
| **Onset** | Within 2-3 days of delivery | Anytime within the first 12 months |
| **Duration** | Resolves by 2-3 weeks postpartum | Persists beyond 2 weeks and may worsen |
| **Intensity** | Mild to moderate mood swings | Persistent, severe emotional disturbance |
| **Crying** | Tearfulness, often without clear trigger | Uncontrollable crying OR emotional numbness (absence of crying) |
| **Bonding** | Still bonds with baby, may feel overwhelmed | Difficulty bonding, feelings of detachment, possible resentment toward baby |
| **Functioning** | Can care for baby and self with support | Difficulty with basic self-care or baby care |
| **Sleep** | Disrupted by baby but can sleep when baby sleeps | Cannot sleep even when baby sleeps (insomnia) OR sleeps excessively |
| **Appetite** | May fluctuate | Significant loss or compulsive eating |
| **Self-image** | "This is hard" | "I'm failing" / "I'm a terrible mother" / "They'd be better off without me" |
| **Prevalence** | 80% of new mothers | 10-20% of new mothers |
| **AI Action** | Normalize, support, monitor | Suggest professional screening, sustained support |

### PPD Red Flags -- When AI Must Suggest Professional Help

The AI should generate a message recommending professional support when the partner reports any of the following persisting beyond 2 weeks:

1. She says she feels nothing toward the baby (emotional flatness, not anger).
2. She says the baby does not feel like hers or she feels "disconnected."
3. She expresses persistent guilt or worthlessness: "I'm a terrible mother," "I can't do anything right."
4. She has stopped eating or is eating compulsively.
5. She cannot sleep even when the baby sleeps and opportunities exist.
6. She has lost interest in everything, including things she loved before pregnancy.
7. She expresses hopelessness about the future: "It's never going to get better."
8. She avoids being alone with the baby.
9. She has intrusive thoughts about harming the baby (this is more common than people think and causes extreme shame -- she needs help, not judgment).
10. She says she wants to disappear, run away, or cease existing.

**AI Response Template for PPD Concern:**
> "What you're describing sounds like it might be more than the typical adjustment. Many women experience this, and there is effective support available. We'd recommend she speak with her doctor or a postpartum specialist. This is not a failure -- it's a medical condition, and getting help is a sign of strength. [Display: Postpartum Support International 1-800-944-4773 or regional equivalent]."

## 10.2 Postpartum Psychosis (Emergency)

Postpartum psychosis is rare (1-2 per 1,000 births) but is a psychiatric emergency.

| Warning Sign | Description | AI Action |
|---|---|---|
| Hallucinations | Seeing or hearing things that are not there | Immediate Severity 5. Medical emergency. |
| Delusions | Beliefs disconnected from reality (the baby is possessed, she has a divine mission) | Immediate Severity 5. Medical emergency. |
| Severe confusion | Cannot orient to time, place, or identity | Immediate Severity 5. Medical emergency. |
| Dramatic mood swings | Cycling between euphoria and despair within hours | Elevate to Severity 4. Monitor closely. Suggest urgent medical evaluation. |
| Paranoia | Believes people are trying to take the baby or harm her | Immediate Severity 5. Medical emergency. |
| Sleep refusal | Has not slept for 48+ hours despite opportunity | Elevate to Severity 4. Suggest urgent medical evaluation. |

**AI Response for Suspected Postpartum Psychosis:**
> "What you're describing is a medical emergency. Please take her to the nearest emergency room immediately, or call emergency services now. Postpartum psychosis is treatable, but it requires immediate medical intervention. Do NOT leave her alone with the baby until she has been evaluated. This is not her fault. [Display emergency number and nearest ER information]."

---

## 10.3 Pregnancy Complications -- Emotional Impact

| Complication | Emotional Impact | AI Coaching |
|---|---|---|
| **Miscarriage** | Grief, guilt, self-blame, anger, isolation. She may feel her body failed her. | This is a loss. Treat it as one. Do NOT say "You can try again," "Everything happens for a reason," "At least it was early." SAY: "I'm so sorry. We lost something, and I grieve with you." |
| **Gestational diabetes** | Guilt about diet, fear for baby, frustration with restrictions, feeling "broken." | Normalize. Coach him to share dietary changes: "If she can't eat it, I won't eat it in front of her." |
| **Pre-eclampsia** | Fear of death (hers and baby's), loss of control, forced bed rest frustration. | This is genuinely dangerous. Coach him to take it seriously. Be present. Handle everything. |
| **Preterm labor threat** | Terror. Helplessness. Guilt ("Did I do something wrong?"). | Complete emotional presence. Zero blame. Practical support: "I've packed the bag. I've called the doctor. You focus on resting." |
| **Infertility / difficulty conceiving** | Grief, shame, relationship strain, medical intervention stress. | Validate the pain. Do NOT suggest "just relax and it'll happen." Do NOT blame her. This is shared pain. |
| **Stillbirth** | Catastrophic grief. She delivered a baby who is not alive. This is among the most traumatic experiences possible. | Maximum clinical sensitivity. Professional grief counseling referral is mandatory. The AI provides supportive presence only. No coaching. No action cards. Only: "I am devastated with you. We will get through this together. And I have resources for professional support whenever you're ready." |

---

## 10.4 Partner-Specific Warning Signs

These are signs in the MALE partner that the AI should monitor and address:

| Warning Sign | What It Indicates | AI Intervention |
|---|---|---|
| **Withdrawal from baby** | He is not bonding. Possible paternal depression, fear, or resentment. | Normalize: "Many new fathers feel disconnected at first. It doesn't mean something is wrong with you." Suggest small bonding activities. |
| **Resentment toward baby** | "Our relationship was fine before the baby." | Validate without enabling: "Your feelings are real. The relationship HAS changed. But this is a transition, not a loss. Let's talk about what you need." |
| **Escalating anger** | Sleep deprivation + stress + feeling sidelined = anger risk. | Monitor. If anger is directed at baby or partner, escalate. Suggest: "If you feel anger rising, put the baby in the crib safely and walk away for 2 minutes. Then call someone." |
| **Fear of the baby** | Afraid to hold, afraid of SIDS, afraid of making a mistake. | Common and underreported. Coach: "Every new parent is afraid. The fact that you're scared means you care. Start small -- hold the baby skin-to-skin for 10 minutes." |
| **Returning to "normal" too fast** | He expects the relationship and household to return to pre-baby function quickly. | Educate: "The 'new normal' takes 6-12 months to form. This is not a delay; it's a transformation." |
| **His own depression** | Paternal postpartum depression affects 8-10% of new fathers. Symptoms: withdrawal, irritability, overworking, substance use increase. | Validate and refer: "Men experience postpartum mood changes too. If you're feeling persistently low, talking to someone is not weakness -- it's responsible fatherhood." |
